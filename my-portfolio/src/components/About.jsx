        Hello, <strong>Ale</strong> here!
      </h2>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a full-stack web developer who took the scenic route into
        tech—starting out as a lawyer in Mexico, then diving into digital
        marketing after moving to Canada. That creative detour eventually led me
        to discover a real passion for coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I&apos;ve been combining strategy, design, and clean code to
        build user-friendly web applications that are as functional as they are
        fun to use. Whether it&apos;s front-end flair or back-end logic, I love
        turning ideas into interactive experiences—ideally with a tasty coffee
        and a good playlist by my side.
      </p>
